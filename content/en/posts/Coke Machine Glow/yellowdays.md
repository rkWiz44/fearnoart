## Lyrics

        Summer on, bring on the buzzing past
        Summer on, bring on august trash
        The sweat of Johnny Cash
        The hot-knife to the hash
        The girls in the grass
        Summer, bring it on, oh, at last

        Days that glow and ignite
        And explode into nights
        Nights that scream for morphine
        And swim into the days
        Days of whisky and cake
        Nights of make-believe
        Days you don't believe
        Nights of faith in flames
        And not consumed by flames

        Ah still, summer's always going
        Turning everything Canada-grey
        And I will miss all the not-knowing
        Of those summer days
        But I swear I will take morphine and swim
        If you take one more look at him
        Ah, those yellow days

        Bring on the liquid smoke
        Summer on, night's a blindfold
        Stay close, then this bird has flown
        The bullet hits the bone
        And it's all filmed on a phone
        Summer's getting on, oh, stay close

        Days glowing, igniting
        Exploding into nights
        Nights, ""I'm cold"", I'm here
        ""Hold me closer to the day""
        Days it's in your blood
        Nights you never dreamed
        (It's supposed to be a dream)
        Nights lost in the flood
        And not lost in the flood

        Ah still, summer's always going
        Turning everything Canada-grey
        And I will miss all the not-knowing
        Of all those summer days
        But I swear I will also take morphine and swim
        If you take one more look at him

        Ah, those yellow days
        Ah, those yellow days

## References

The lyrics evoke a sense of nostalgia for carefree summer days filled with intense experiences and fleeting moments. References to Johnny Cash, whiskey, and morphine suggest a reckless abandon and a desire to escape into intoxication. The imagery of "liquid smoke" and "nights that scream for morphine" creates a sense of darkness and danger lurking beneath the surface of summer's carefree facade. The repeated phrase "turning everything Canada-grey" hints at the inevitable end of summer and the return to a more mundane reality.

## Essay

"Yellow Days," the eighth track on Gord Downie's 2010 album The Grand Bounce, is a bittersweet ode to the fleeting nature of summer and the intense experiences that mark this season of freedom and escape. The song captures the essence of youthful abandon, with its references to "August trash," "girls in the grass," and "days of whiskey and cake." Downie's lyrics paint a picture of days that blur into nights, fueled by a desire to live in the moment and push boundaries.

However, beneath the surface of summer's carefree facade, there is a sense of darkness and danger. The imagery of "liquid smoke" and "nights that scream for morphine" suggests a desire to escape not only into pleasure but also into oblivion. The repeated line, "I swear I will take morphine and swim / If you take one more look at him," hints at a deeper emotional turmoil, perhaps fueled by jealousy or heartbreak.

The song also touches upon the theme of Canadian identity, with the recurring phrase "turning everything Canada-grey." This line can be interpreted as a reference to the inevitable end of summer and the return to a colder, more subdued reality. However, it also speaks to a broader sense of melancholy that often permeates Canadian culture, a sense of longing for something more, something beyond the everyday.

"Yellow Days" is a powerful and evocative song that captures the bittersweet beauty of summer and the complex emotions that accompany its passing. Downie's lyrics are both celebratory and mournful, reflecting on the fleeting nature of youth, the intensity of experience, and the inevitable return to reality. The song leaves the listener with a sense of nostalgia for days gone by and a yearning for the freedom and passion of those "yellow days."
