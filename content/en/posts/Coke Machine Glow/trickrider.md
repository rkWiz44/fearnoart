## Lyrics

So this is fucking off by degrees
And I suppose we turned out to be not quite Hawaii
But I can float back to sleep
'Cause at least you're lying to me

Like music that dances from glowing apartments
As shadows entwine into a creamy darkness
Like jewellery hung down from rich silhouettes
Portrays on the sidewalk where wetness reflects
All the colours of evening and the onset of lights
Like the promise of nothing, sweet nothing tonight

So this is enacting ecstasy
And I suppose we turned out to be bathroom graffiti
But I can float back to sleep
'Cause at least you're lying to me

Like shovelling hope into the infinite us
Till the world surges in yelling, ""This is a drug bust""
Might turn up the heat and make us into one person
But then the temperature plunges and the predicament worsens
Till we're a fleck of new snow on the eyelash of a cow
And we melt away, melt away, melt away, melt
Melt away, melt away, melt
Melt away, melt away, melt
Melt away, melt

## Essay

"11th Fret," the sixth track on Gord Downie's 2003 album Battle of the Nudes, is a haunting and evocative song that delves into the complexities of love, desire, and the search for oblivion. The song begins with a sense of disillusionment and disappointment, as the speaker realizes that their relationship has failed to live up to the idealized fantasy of a tropical paradise like Hawaii.

The lyrics are filled with vivid imagery that conveys the intensity and fragility of the relationship. The speaker describes "music that dances from glowing apartments" and "shadows entwining into a creamy darkness," creating a sense of intimacy and desire. However, these moments of connection are fleeting, and the speaker is left with a feeling of emptiness and loss.

The song also explores the themes of addiction and oblivion. The speaker refers to "bathroom graffiti" and "shovelling hope into the infinite us," suggesting a desperate attempt to escape from reality through intoxication and self-deception. However, these attempts at escapism ultimately lead to a deeper sense of despair and isolation.

The song's chorus, "Melt away, melt away, melt," captures the sense of longing and dissolution that permeates the lyrics. The speaker desires to disappear into oblivion, to escape the pain of their shattered dreams and failed relationships. However, this desire for oblivion is ultimately self-destructive, as it leads to a loss of self and a numbing of the soul.

"11th Fret" is a powerful and moving song that explores the dark side of love, desire, and the search for meaning in life. Downie's lyrics are both poetic and visceral, capturing the raw emotions of heartbreak, addiction, and despair. The song is a reminder that even in the depths of our struggles, we must never give up hope and continue to strive for connection and fulfillment in life.
