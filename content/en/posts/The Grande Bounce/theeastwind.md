## Lyrics

        Hello again, my friends
        I’ve come to see you again
        Like the East Wind
        The laziest wind
        It doesn’t go around you, it goes through you

        Night is like a room
        It makes the little things
        In your head
        Too important

        It doesn’t go around you, it goes through you
        It doesn’t go around you, it goes right through

        No I do not love you
        Hate the word
        That private tyranny
        Inside a public sound

        It doesn’t go around you, it goes through you
        It doesn’t go around you, it goes right through

        Hello again my friends
        I’ve come to see you again
        I'm the East Wind
        The laziest Wind

        It doesn’t go around you, it goes through you
        It doesn’t go around you, it blows right through (x2)
