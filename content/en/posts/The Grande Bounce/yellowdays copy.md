        Summer on, bring on the buzzing past
        Summer on, bring on august trash
        The sweat of Johnny Cash
        The hot-knife to the hash
        The girls in the grass
        Summer, bring it on, oh, at last

        Days that glow and ignite
        And explode into nights
        Nights that scream for morphine
        And swim into the days
        Days of whisky and cake
        Nights of make-believe
        Days you don't believe
        Nights of faith in flames
        And not consumed by flames

        Ah still, summer's always going
        Turning everything Canada-grey
        And I will miss all the not-knowing
        Of those summer days
        But I swear I will take morphine and swim
        If you take one more look at him
        Ah, those yellow days

        Bring on the liquid smoke
        Summer on, night's a blindfold
        Stay close, then this bird has flown
        The bullet hits the bone
        And it's all filmed on a phone
        Summer's getting on, oh, stay close
